## Project Mood

Create a badge by pointing an image markup tag to `/:owner/:repo.svg` e.g. `/healeycodes/project-mood.svg`. The API works with any public repository.

Git commits are scanned using the GitHub API to create a dynamic badge based off average commit time.

SVGs will have the average commit time as hover text via the inner-SVG tag `<title>`.

### Roadmap ðŸš—

If I continue working on this, these are the things that will need to be addressed:

- Caching:
  - Repositories should be scanned infrequently rather than per request.
  - We can store the most recently requested SVGs in memory.
  - Basically, don't generate the SVG for every request (which is used for the prototype).
- Blended colors depending on average time rather than fixed colors.

### Install

`npm i`

<br>

### Authentication

For running and testing, set `GHTOKEN` to your GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and `USERAGENT` to a custom user-agent (required by GitHub).

<br>

### Run

(Optional) set a port via `PORT` -- `8080` by default.

`npm start`

<br>

### Test

This repo uses Travis CI which currently builds and tests for commits/branches/PRs

The test framework is Mocha/SuperTest.

Set `NODE_ENV` to `test`.

`npm test`

```
  GET /healeycodes/project-mood
    âˆš responds with an SVG (586ms)

  GET /healeycodes/missing-or-mispelled-project
    âˆš responds with the default errored SVG (395ms)
```
